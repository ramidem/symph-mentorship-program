      <h3>Who Is Involved?</h3>
      <p>Mentoring provides an opportunity to affect the future; you transmit a part of yourself to each person you mentor – your ideals, ethics, and professionalism. This legacy continues long after you retire. By helping a mentee succeed, you will rediscover your passion for tech such as in development, design, marketing, sales, etc. You can learn new skills, and gain the satisfaction of knowing that you have made a difference in someone’s life.</p>

      <h3>Who Is Involved?</h3>
      <p>
        <em>This is the first step of being a mentee!</em>

      <p>You are fueled with the passion to succeed in your career, willing to learn and put the time and effort to practice tips and advice from your mentor and you are clear in communicating your strengths and weaknesses as well as updating us on your progress in the program to further grow. And have respect for the program, honesty, and open-mindedness in getting feedback, and maintain the dedication and positivity in seeing the 4-month program until the end.</p>
